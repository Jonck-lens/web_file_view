# web file view

---

 A very simple project, developed with python flask, that can be used for temporary web file browsing needs

---

## 1. how to using
* first, This project requires py, the recommended version is 3.12.
* You'll also need to install some python modules, which you can do with the following command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Then run main.py , Under normal circumstances, the project should start successfully

---
## 2. Some other things
* 1 . In addition, you need to do more detailed configuration in config.ini
* 2 . As for the api system, I'm not going to make a companion app for it yet, because it's probably not as convenient as viewing it directly on the web

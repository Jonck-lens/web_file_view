[中文](https://github.com/Jonck-lens/web_file_view/blob/master/readme.md)<p>
 A very simple project, developed with python flask, that can be used for temporary web file browsing needs</p>

 You can conveniently modify the html template file to customize your page

## 1. how to using
* first, This project requires py, the recommended version is 3.12.
* You'll also need to install some python modules, which you can do with the following command

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Then run main.py , Under normal circumstances, the project should start successfully

---
## 2. Some other things
* 1 . In addition, you need to do more detailed configuration in config.ini
* 2 . As for the api system, I'm not going to make a companion app for it yet, because it's probably not as convenient as viewing it directly on the web
* 3 . Note: Theoretically speaking, this project can only run on the Windows platform


This is my first project and also my first time publishing a project on GitHub.</p> The project may seem rather poor, but please don't make fun of me for it.
